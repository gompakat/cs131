This command is called organizer.

What it does: It organizes your files in a directory by moving similar files into new subdirectories. So all .pdf files will be grouped in the pdf directory and so on the so forth.

Why is it useful: I think that this could be useful if you have a project with many many files of information and it might become difficult to sort through them, especially if you have many different file types.

How to use: ./organizer [path to directory]
